# ‚úÖ Test Payment Page - Current Status

## What's Working Now

1. **‚úÖ Account Created**: `customer@demo.test` with password `Demo1234!`
2. **‚úÖ Auto-login Fixed**: Page will now auto-login successfully (backend returns `tokens.accessToken`)
3. **‚úÖ Wallet Created**: Auto-created wallet at `0xE2417c9F886bD2A1a093a2549336193DbB6CFa67`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issue

The account has a wallet with **0 balance**. The backend auto-creates a new wallet on registration, so we cannot import the funded test wallet (0x5bdd...943F with 0.5 U2U).

## üöÄ Next Actions

### Option 1: Fund the Existing Wallet (Recommended)

Transfer U2U tokens from the funded test wallet to the new wallet:

```bash
# From address (funded): 0x5bdd48d5014807d1B5bf684eA6F25f404104943F (0.5 U2U)
# To address (new): 0xE2417c9F886bD2A1a093a2549336193DbB6CFa67 (0 U2U)

# You can do this via:
# 1. U2U wallet app
# 2. MetaMask with imported private key
# 3. Backend transfer endpoint (if available)
```

### Option 2: Test the Auto-Login Flow

Even though the wallet has 0 balance, you can test that auto-login works:

1. Refresh the page: http://localhost:3000/test-payment
2. Check that it shows:
   - ‚úÖ Backend: online
   - ‚úÖ Auth: ready
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Balance: 0.0 U2U
3. Payment will fail with "insufficient balance" but auto-login should work!

### Option 3: Use a Different Account

Create a new account with a different email and try the import flow again. Or delete the existing wallet from database first.

## üí° Recommendations

1. **For immediate testing**: Fund the wallet `0xE2417c9F886bD2A1a093a2549336193DbB6CFa67` with at least 0.1 U2U

2. **For future**: Consider adding a backend endpoint to:
   - Delete/replace existing wallet
   - Transfer funds between wallets
   - Import wallet with force flag

3. **Alternative**: Use merchant account to test, as merchants likely need to fund their own wallets anyway

## üìû How to Fund the Wallet

If you have access to the funded test wallet private key, you can use MetaMask:

1. Import private key: `0xa989063089f0050d6232c2c8f8b3558e5e16f4ed1f41b3d688e88501fdc98b5d`
2. Add U2U Solaris Mainnet network (Chain ID: 39, RPC: https://rpc-mainnet.uniultra.xyz)
3. Send 0.1 U2U to: `0xE2417c9F886bD2A1a093a2549336193DbB6CFa67`
4. Refresh test-payment page and test!
